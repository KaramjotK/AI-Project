Reciprocal Job Recommendation System
•The "Reciprocal Job Recommendation System," caters to the needs of two key users: job recruiters and job seekers.
•Job seekers upload their resumes, and the system utilizes NLTK and required libraries to extract their skill sets. It
subsequently offers viable job recommendations by employing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, showcasing
the top 10 most relevant job listings.
•For recruiters, the system offers a streamlined input process for job openings, position, company name, location, and
necessary skills.
•The recommendation process relies on content-based techniques to align job details with skills identified in resumes.
